# Email Testing Guide

## Current Email Configuration

**All form submissions are sent TO:** `mahatmavalley@gmail.com`

**Sender (FROM):** `Mahatma Valley Pre-school <onboarding@resend.dev>`

**Reply-To:** The email address entered in the form

---

## Important Notes

### Using Resend Test Domain
Currently using `onboarding@resend.dev` as the sender. This is Resend's test domain and has limitations:

1. ‚úÖ **Works for testing** - Emails will be delivered
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **May go to spam** - Test domain emails often land in spam folders
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limited sending** - Only 100 emails per day on free tier

### Check Your Spam Folder
If you're not receiving emails at mahatmavalley@gmail.com:
1. Check the **Spam/Junk folder**
2. Mark emails from `onboarding@resend.dev` as "Not Spam"
3. Add to contacts/safe senders

```

### Benefits:

## Troubleshooting

### Emails not arriving at mahatmavalley@gmail.com?

1. **Check Spam Folder First** ‚≠ê Most common issue
2. **Check Resend Dashboard**
   - Go to [resend.com/emails](https://resend.com/emails)
   - View sent emails and delivery status
   - Check for errors

3. **Verify API Key**
   - Ensure `RESEND_API_KEY` is set correctly in Vercel/Netlify
   - Key: `re_7iA3hHrp_KRMgGFFtrFFED9tLYgkVBNUV`

4. **Check Browser Console**
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Look for errors when submitting forms

5. **Test API Endpoint**
   - After deployment, test: `https://your-site.vercel.app/api/send-email`
   - Should return error for GET request (expected)

### Emails going to wrong address?

The code is configured to send ALL emails to: `mahatmavalley@gmail.com`

If emails are going elsewhere, check:
- Resend dashboard for actual recipient
- Browser console for any client-side redirects
- Verify you're testing the deployed version, not local
